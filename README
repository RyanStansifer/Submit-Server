#Submit Server#

The purpose of the submit server is to facilitate and organize the
transfer of student coursework in a way that is convenient and uniform
to the instructor.  Users register with their e-mail address and
receive a control code which uniquely identifies them.

The service is completely independent of student records,
authentication systems, course management systems.

The project is stable having been used for more than a decade in about
10 classes per semester.

GUI clients have all but disappeared being replaced by invidual HTML forms
and a php file running the command line client.  Otherwise only the command
line interface to the client is available.

java -Dpassword="${PASSWORD}" -Dcourse=${CLASS} -Dproject=${PROJECT} -Dcommand=create -cp client.jar submit.client.Admin
java -Dpassword="${PASSWORD}" -Dcourse=${CLASS} -Dproject=${PROJECT} -Dcommand=turnon  -cp client.jar submit.client.Admin
java -Dpassword="${PASSWORD}" -Dcourse=${CLASS} -Dproject=${PROJECT} -Dcommand=turnoff -cp client.jar submit.client.Admin
java                          -Dcourse=${CLASS} -Dproject=${PROJECT} -cp client.jar submit.client.Download ${PROJECT}.jar

java -Dcontrol=${CONTROL} -Dcourse=${CLASS} -Dproject=${PROJECT} -cp client.jar submit.client.Submit ${FILE}


The submit server does not have a feedback system.  Instructors typically have
their unqiue and highly idiosyncric tool-chain (variously automated) for
analysis, execution of programs, detection of similarity, and grading.

## Instructions ##

The server needs a port, a mail server, access to write WWW pages to
acknowledge the submissions, and a directory in which to store
submissions.  It uses a simple flat-file database of registrations and
simple files.  

 Setup the arguments to the program
-Dverbose=n
-Dmailhost=...    # server which will send mail on behalf of the submit server
-Ddatabase=...    # directory for the internal database of registrations
-Droot=...        # directory in which the submissions are storee
-Dreport.DIR=...  # directory in which acknowledgement reports are written
-Dreport.URL=...  # URL at which the reports can be viewed on the WWW


The student registers once with the submit server declaring their name
and giving an e-mail address.  The student receives a control code
which is valid until revoked by the server administer.  (We usually
start anew every year; not every semester.)  A student can submit to
any available assignment for any established course.  Any type and any
number of files can be submited.  Mutliple submissions are possible.

An administertor can create a course by creating a directory with a
password file in it.  And intstructor can create an assignment for the
course, allow submissions, and turn off submisssions with the
password.  The lateest submission for each student can be downloaded
as a single Java JAR file.
